## Run on your own local machine

To run locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the development server using `npm start`
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

Use cannot use the link outside your local network. To access from outside your local network you may use `ssl tunneling` or `port forwarding`. But that is very complex to setup. You can use `ngrok` instead or other similar solutions.

2. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
3. Make changes and commit them using `git commit -m "Add some feature"`

### Add more stickers
+ Copy images into `/public/stickers/YOUR_STICKER_NAME/` folder
+ Create two subfolders named `animated` and `static` and put your sticker in the directories. Name your image in count from 1. 
```
    1.webp
    2.webp
    3.webp
    ...
    ...
    19.webp
    20.webp
```
It's very important to have two folders. If your sticker is not animated then put the files both of the directories.
In the `./public/stickers/stickersConfig.js` file, add your sticker name and count. 

**Note: The list order will be followed in the sticker menu.**
```js
const Stickers = [
    {"name": "cat", "count": "29", "icon": "15"}, //sticker on the cat folder which contains 29 webp files and 15th image is the icon.
    {"name": "cutecat", "count": "33", "icon": "30"},
    {"name": "skully", "count": "26", "icon": "23"},
    {"name": "frog", "count": "30", "icon": "18"},
]
```
