Poketab Messenger is a temporary chat application that allows users to create and join group chats with up to 10 people. The app utilizes a unique key system to ensure privacy and security, as users can only join a chat by using a key generated and sent by the server.

- Share images, files, audio, and stickers with others in the chat
- Built-in audio player and recorder to play and record audio within the app

- All data is stored only on the device, ensuring maximum privacy and security

## Run on your own local machine

To run locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

To build the production version:

1. Type `npm run build` to compile all frontend `javascript` code to a single js bundle.
2. Type `tsc` to compile all `typescript` code into `javascript`
3. Commit
4. Deploy
You cannot use the link outside your local network. To access from outside your local network you may use `ssl tunneling` or `port forwarding`. But that is very complex to setup. You can use `ngrok` instead or other similar solutions.
