## How It Works

Poketab Messenger ensures privacy with temporary dynamic keys that authenticate and join users to chat rooms. Messages are encrypted and secure, and only users with the key can access them.

When a message is sent, it is delivered to the server, and the sender receives an acknowledgment that it has been sent. The server then relays the message to all other connected clients. If a client is inactive, they will receive a notification when they receive a message.

When a user sends an image, the server generates a low-resolution thumbnail and sends it to all other clients instantly. The original image is uploaded to the server, and a dynamic link is created for other clients to download the file. File upload uses the same mechanism.

For location sharing, Poketab Messenger uses the browser's built-in location API.

## Conclusion

Poketab Messenger is a secure and user-friendly app that enables you to chat with your friends and family without compromising your privacy. With its fun features and easy-to-use interface, Poketab Messenger is the perfect choice for all your instant messaging needs.
